# Minesweeper

This is a very small MineSweeper demo project written in Java, that uses [JavaUI](https://github.com/Delthas/JavaUI).

The project also includes a very small server backend for leaderboards.

Use ```mvn install``` to compile. The ```target``` folder will include a ```minesweeper-client.jar``` game client JAR file and a ```minesweeper-server.jar``` server JAR file. Make sure to change the hardcoded server hostname in the client if hosting your Minesweeper server.

Pre-built releases are available [in the releases tab](https://github.com/Delthas/minesweeper/releases/). The default server is most often running, you may but do not have to host your own.
